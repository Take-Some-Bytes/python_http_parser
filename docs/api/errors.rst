Version |version|.

The ``python_http_parser.errors`` module houses various exceptions this module could raise.

-------------------
``.code`` property
-------------------
All exceptions raised by this package have a ``.code`` property, which is guaranteed to
not change (or not change as often) throughout different ``python_http_parser`` versions.
Here's a table of error codes and the exception class they match with.

================ ========================

.. py:exception:: LengthError

   Raised when something length-related fails.

   For example, if a header line is too short.

   This is only raised by the |parse()| function.

.. py:exception:: ParsingError

   The generic "catch-all" exception that is raised when there is no other appropriate
   exception to raise.

   **NOTE**: ``ParsingError`` *may* be slowly replaced by other more specific exception
   classes in the long term.

   This is only raised by the |parse()| function.

.. py:exception:: NewlineError

   Raised when something related to newlines fails.

   For example, if a bare CR is received, or if LF is received in strict mode.

.. py:exception:: FatalParsingError

   A fatal variation of ``ParsingError``; ``FatalParsingError`` s raised cannot be ignored.

   ``FatalParsingError`` is currently not raised.

.. py:exception:: InvalidStructureError

   Raised when something doesn't match an expected structure.

   For example if the request line is not in the correct format.

   This is only raised by the |parse()| function.

.. py:exception:: DoneError

   Raised when a parser/processor is already done parsing/processing, but calls were made
   to process/parse more bytes.

.. py:exception:: InvalidVersion

   Raised when the received HTTP version is invalid.

.. py:exception:: InvalidStatus

   Raised when the received HTTP status code is invalid.

.. py:exception:: UnexpectedChar

   Raised when an unexpected character is encountered.

.. py:exception:: InvalidToken

   Raised when non-|HTTP token|_ characters are received where a token is required.

.. py:exception:: InvalidURI

   Raised when non-URI characters are received where a URI is required.

   As the :py:class:`HTTPParser <python_http_parser.stream.HTTPParser>` does not
   *parse* URIs, this error is only raised when invalid *characters* are received.

.. py:exception:: InvalidHeaderVal

   Raised when invalid characters are encountered in the value of a HTTP header.

.. py:exception:: InvalidChunk

   Raised when a chunk that is being processed by the |ChunkedProcessor| has syntax
   errors (e.g. missing a newline).

.. py:exception:: InvalidChunkSize

   Raised when a chunk size is invalid (e.g. has invalid characters or is too large).

.. py:exception:: InvalidChunkExtensions

   Raised when chunk extensions are too large.

   As the |ChunkedProcessor| does not *parse* chunk extensions, this error is only raised
   if the size of chunk extensions exceed the :ref:`maximum <chunk-extension-max>`.

.. py:exception:: BodyProcessorRequired
   
   Raised when a :py:class:`BodyProcessor <python_http_parser.body.BodyProcessor>` is required,
   but none was set.

.. |HTTP token| replace:: HTTP token
.. |ChunkedProcessor| replace:: :py:class:`ChunkedProcessor <python_http_parser.body.ChunkedProcessor>`
.. |parse()| replace:: :py:func:`parse() <python_http_parser.parse>`
