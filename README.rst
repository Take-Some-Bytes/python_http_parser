 ``python_http_parser``
========================
Simple HTTP parser written in pure python.

``python_http_parser`` has only been tested with `CPython 3.8`_â€“it is *not* guaranteed to
work with any other versions and/or implementations of Python. You are welcome to
test this package with other implementations and/or versions of Python, and you may also
open an issue if you think a compatibility issue between this project and a implementation
and/or version of Python could be fixed.

**This project is not complete**! Do not, I repeat, **DO NOT** use it for production.
