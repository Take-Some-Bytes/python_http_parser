 Dependencies
--------------
This package has one production dependency: |typing_extensions|_. It is only used for type hinting
compatiblity with Python versions earlier than 3.8, so it shouldn't add too much overhead.
This project also requires some tools if you wish to develop or test the code--those requirements could
be found in the ``/requirements`` folder.

Python >=3.6 is required to use this package.
