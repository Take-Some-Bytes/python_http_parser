Here's a few contribution guidelines for ``python_http_parser``.

 Feature Requests and Bugs

To submit feature requests and bugs, use the Issue Tracker built into GitHub.
For bugs:

- Please list your Python version and OS.
- Please list the steps needed to reproduce the problem.
- Issues that only exist within unsupported Python versions will not be fixed.

Note: I have already planned out a lot of the upcoming features for ``python_http_parser``,
so it *may* be a bit hard to convince me to add features that I have not planned,
but if you have ample justification, your feature request will probably be implemented.
